The Nightmare's perilous circumstances and conditions make it a
struggle to exist almost anywhere in it. That's before accounting for
creatures that need to eat you to survive and people that want to eat
you for fun, although in the latter case, something 'normal' is more
likely, like simply crushing your skull open.
</p>

<p>
To overcome this challenge, people began forming groups in the
earliest days to increase their chances of survival in numbers. This
usually succeeded and greatly prolonged the lifespan of those within
their prototypical nation-states up until the removal of their leader
either by the leader's death or the great demoness Democracy and her
'term limits', 'impeachments', and 'elections'.
</p>

<p>
Generations of life could certainly go on like this but the end of
such large efforts and waste of the investment of imperceptible time
by a civilization's people from a mere famine/plague/vote was
ultimately not pleasing to the cosmic eye, <a href="#orga427297"><b>Sotla</b></a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge2b560a">
<p>
<i>Tell the story! C'mon!</i>
</p>

<p>
For countless millennia, the surface of the Nightmare has existed as a bubbling pot of ideologies, nations, settlements, communities, and endless sinkholes into nothingness. This pattern changed with the arrival of two beings on this mortal plane: The Kommissar, and the Kommandant.
</p>

<p>
Both were created by the blood of Sotla, and possess no need for worldly pleasures beyond the faith and adoration of their chosen people.

<p>
<b>Liver Failure</b> once constituted a region of wetlands inhabited by innumerable human settlements, some small and some large. This was until the Kommandant arrived and orchestrated a popular coup. This would come to be called the Night of Long Pipes, after the lead pipes wielded by the Kommandant's paramilitaries. Now that His rule is cemented, He aims to transform Liver Failure into a hardy national organism capable of thriving under the harsh conditions of the Nightmare, with Himself as its central nervous system.
</p>

<p>
The workers of Liver Failure find fulfillment in unending labor, toiling until death however it may find them. They are the red blood cells of a great beast that only grows stronger the more they sacrifice of themselves to the unceasing machine. The Kommandant's Sanitar Squad, on the other hand, do their best to serve as Liver Failure's white blood cells. Not necessarily protecting the red, but eliminating pathological threats before they reach the vital organs.

<p>
The Kommunist republic of <b>Kidneystan</b> to the northeast has seen a significantly less tumultuous founding than its "little brother" in Liver Failure. Orders of magnitude larger and more industrially capable, the Kommandant seems to have tripped where the Kommissar strode, enraging the already roaring flame of their mutual rivalry. Built around the bustling city of Renalgrad, it stretches northeast into uncountable miles of snowy, frostbitten wasteland.

What <i>is</i> certain is that this thing watches us from the darkness above, below, and all around us.

<p>
Despite the deniability of every other being that's popped up in mortal mythology since history were first recorded and mutilated, none have been able to deny the existence of Sotla, not even the Kommandant. It's the one thing that matches any description of godly beings that can be proven to exist.

or sleep.

<p>
All that is necessary for Him to live is the mere presence of
starblood in His vessels and the structural integrity of His brain.
</p>

<p>
Such a leader often lives centuries, sometimes millennia to prolong
His land's history and expand His influence &#x2013; if war and betrayal
does not kill Him first, madness will.
</p>

<p>
With only the mind to listen to within the body, each more uncountable
year of continued existence contributes to erratic and irrational
behavior in the immortal leader until He kills Himself or makes the
kind of mistakes that will get Him killed.

to surpass and invade His rival's domain.
