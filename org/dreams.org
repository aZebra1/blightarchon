#+title: Eclipse Dreams
#+STARTUP: overview

Things we hope we can put in the game, someday.

* The Round
The Eclipse does not last forever. Each round of the game is planned to last roughly 4 hours, depending on the competence of the players and any extenuating circumstances.
** Lobby
*** The Contract
"How pleasant, some fresh meat for the feast."
"Take this paper and read it over, sign at the bottom."

~TERMS OF ENTRY~

Nobody under the age of 18 should be playing this game under any circumstances. The Eclipse is considered unsafe for those who suffer from epileptic seizures or who are otherwise sensitive to bright, flashing lights.

You would also be wise to avoid The Eclipse if you are sensitive to the following: Jumpscares, graphic violence and gore, Satanic and occult themes, racism, fascism, narcotics, drugging, nonconsensual surgery, or the command line.

Immersion is the most important part of The Eclipse, and it is the responsibility of all who participate (INCLUDING YOU) to maintain it. Avoid referring to ingame mechanics as written, and instead consider them from the perspective of the character in the world; Similarly, don't look too closely at what's mechanically beneficial or not, and instead consider your character's internal motives and logic.

Do not simply perform actions because they are "optimal". This is not a game to be picked through for the most efficient way of achieving a certain result, and then beaten into the ground with "meta strategies". Take risks, make mistakes, and behave irrationally; It's more fun that way for everyone.

Though concepts from our world may be included in the Nightmare, this universe is, for all other intents and purposes, entirely distinct from our own. Do not refer to things that do not exist here, such as real-life social constructs (gender, race, sex, religion, politics), people, and events. Your memes aren't funny, either.

There are no set rules to this game outside of what has already been stated here, and you will never have to justify your in-character actions to a server administrator; Of course, the same applies to every other player as well. Killed by a random scumbag at roundstart just because he wanted to know what human meat tastes like? Better luck next round, you could have done the same to him.

Respect your fellow players and remember the person on the other side of the screen. You are just as much of an actor as a participant, here to enrich others' experiences just as much as you enjoy your own. Remember this. While you are technically permitted to do whatever you want, think about how your actions impact others' time playing the game. Just because it won't get you banned doesn't mean it isn't a dick move.

By signing this contract, you agree to all of its provisions and understand that violating the word or spirit of this text may result in divine intervention against you or expulsion from the Eclipse, regardless of whether or not you waste your money on us.

SIGNED, ~STEAMID~

"Now you're mine, and you will never be the same again."

**** Interface
Questions from the puppetmaker are shown as large moving yellow text. The player answers one question at a time with a menu underneath.

Beneath or beside this menu are notes about the selected answer. (e.g. When a fear is selected, it will print that fear's description)
*** Cheat Codes
Cheat Codes are 3-character strings that provide some kind of advantage to the player in the coming round.
They are bought with ~GUILT~, which is acquired by doing well in the game and earning the favor of Sotla. Much like stem cells or chromosomes.

- Les Rallizes Denudes
- Original Amytune
** Phases of the Eclipse
*** Lobby
Before and after a round, players exist in the LOBBY without control of a character. The lobby is a GUI where players can select and create a character for the upcoming round, see the headcount and maximum occupation of FATES, and talk to other players out of character.
*** Prelude
The first several minutes of a round are calm, with the workers locked in communal housing and forced to fraternize with eachother while the Sanitar Squad is briefed on their duties. The Prelude is considered to end when the Sanitars open the bunkhouse doors.
*** Penumbra
The vast majority of the rest of the round. The game operates as normal, and the ~TROUBLE~ slowly inches forward.
*** Contact
While things have gotten progressively worse over the course of the Penumbra, Contact is where the worst begins. ~TROUBLE~ will make itself apparent, and it's up to the playerbase to make the best of waning normalcy in order to see themselves through the Totality.
*** Totality
The climax of the round. All normality breaks down, and players will likely spend the majority of this phase running, screaming, fighting, or hiding.
*** THE END
The victor of the day is decided: The Nightmare, or The City?
** Advance Conditions
Things that cause the Phase to advance.
** Win Conditions
- Liver Failure Forever!
  The Kommandant and a sizable portion of Liver Failure has survived!
  The Kommandant and at least 6 other Scum and Sanitars have survived.
- Liver Failure has Fallen.
    The City could not escape annihilation, but the Kommandant did!
  The Kommandant has survived and left the city.
** Loss Conditions
- DEATH!
  The city is dead, and the Kommandant spent too long mourning. Now he's dead, too.
- daemon
  Netcultists have successfully summoned daemon.exe. This reality is lost.
** Antagonists
*** Netcultists
(we should probably create some method of hacking that all players can use for their own ends, rather than building it around the antagonists -danku)

These phreaks hijack terminals and turn the city against itself through lies, blackmail, and malicious public services! They hide in the general populace, acting as normal workers, while living second lives as the most insidious threat to Liver Failure.

Netcultists have a 5 ~COLD~ attribute and are the most talented hackers in the nightmare.

Their goal is to spread daemon.exe to as many computers as possible, and eventually summon it to mortal reality.
**** Abilities
 Their brain's wireless connection to daemon allows them to install a variety of malicious applications without having to find them on a floppy disk.
 These allow them to:
- Connect, one by one, to every SNAIL cerial number, saving terminals found. Takes a long time.
- Remotely connect to and control a terminal.
- Connect to radios and hijack the reports.
- Produce a ghost key
 - A ghost key remains on the screen until a ghost collects it. The ghost can carry it to another terminal to infect it for a reward of PLASM.
- Infect a terminal with daemon, turning its background red and text black.
- Teleport between infected terminals.
- Eventually summon daemon through ritual.
**** Abilities (2)
As the hands of feet of daemon, you have numerous tools at your disposal that let you work on a higher plane than mortal hackers. Your most important possession is The Cradle, the resting place of daemon's seed.
***** Baptism
A computer is baptized simply by running ~daemon.exe~. Nothing will appear to happen when the program is run, but the computer will never be the same again.

A baptized computer opens up numerous hidden commands
***** Sorcery
*** Demokrats
The final adherents to Democracy, the Great Demoness.
Preach your word to the people of Liver Failure and install as many copies of voting software as you can. Force the Kommandant to hold an election, or take him out of the picture and hold it yourself.
*** Bacterians
Wasteland warriors from the steppes of Bacteria have set their sights on Liver Failure as their new home, and plan to make way for the migration of their people. Weaken the city with biological and sewer warfare before the horde of migrants arrive at Contact.
*** The Ripper
A mad stalker with piercing eyes who watches and follows his victims from afar, poisoning them and stealing their blood for use in rituals. The poison makes their blood hospitable to you- though you can only use it while your victim is alive.

Killing your victims forever cuts you off from their blood, but gives you great pleasure (and a body to scare the other little sheep with).

The Ripper gradually improves his ability to kill and stalk throughout the course of the round, juggling more and more thralls and strategically executing them to prevent his own capture or depressive suicide.
**** Rituals
- Bloodsight
  You can see your thralls wherever they go.
- Fatigue
  Your thralls will be weak and slow.
- Seizures
  Your thralls will be struck with a non-fatal seizure.
- Permanence
  No witchdoctor can remove your curse now.
- Terminal
  Offer a phrase, and all of your thralls will die upon your saying that phrase.
* Roleplay & Immersion
** DONE [#A] Music
The game needs ambient and uncomfortable music to be immersive.
*** TODO ~H:M:S~ Parser
Inputting audio duration is too annoying.
It should be possible to get, say, ~666~ from ~'11:06'~.
*** TODO Unused Music
Not all of the music made for us is implemented.
It should be.
** Character
*** TODO Attributes
Each caste of society should have different names for these attributes, but are entirely cosmetic.
#+begin_quote
i don't kill puppies for satan but sometimes i yell at my dog
#+end_quote
**** =COLD=
"this is how heartless and calculating a motherfucker
you are. make cold rolls whenever you do something that
requires exactness, patience, knowledge, or great care,
like disarming a security system or reading a book. cold corresponds to intelligence in a normal game. a regular
person has a cold of 1, and hannibal lecter has a cold of 5."

=COLD= represents a corpse's practical intelligence, be it interfacing with a terminal effectively, diagnosing and fixing a broken machine or printing a circuit board.
The foreman has a =COLD= of 4.
With a =COLD= of 0, you are illiterate and cannot read or write. This means you can't use terminals. Or big words.
**** =FUCKED UP=
"this is how devious, deviant and weird a
motherfucker you are. make fucked up rolls whenever you do something that requires paranoia, edginess, quick wits, or sneakiness, like hiding under a bridge or noticing
that somebody’s disturbed your freezer unit. fucked up
corresponds to perception and stealth in a normal game. a regular person has a fucked up of 1, and that guy from se7en
has a fucked up of 5"

For our uses, =FUCKED UP= represents street smarts, social perception and being a trickster that can uncover your secrets from a seemingly-ordinary conversation.
You can steal without being noticed, keep things hidden on your person. You might known others peoples' phobias and motives.
=FUCKED UP= affects how hard you hit with sharp weapons.
Those with high =FUCKED UP= can hear conversations from longer distances. This is more apparent with whispering. For eavesdropping.
We may also used =FUCKED UP= as dexterity.
Misfits have a =FUCKED UP= of 4-5.
**** =MEAN=
"this is how violent and ruthless a motherfucker you
are. make mean rolls whenever you do something that requires strength, viciousness, rage, or brutality, like pulling a trigger or snapping handcuffs. mean corresponds to strength and skill in a normal game. a regular person has a mean of 1, and mickey and mallory from natural born killers have a mean of 5."

=MEAN= is equivilent to brute strength. It affects how hard you hit with blunt weapons.
That's all there is to it, but who needs to be fancy when you can hit like a truck?
Sanitars have a =MEAN= of 3-5, depending on their rank and thus, training.
**** =RELENTLESS=
"this is how gutsy and powerful a
motherfucker you are. make relentless rolls whenever you do something that requires endurance, discipline, tenacity, or the will to carry on, like swimming underwater or chewing through leather straps. relentless corresponds to stamina in a normal game. a regular person has a relentless of 1, and jason has a relentless of 5."

=RELENTLESS= is equivalent to endurance, it affects how much pain you feel, how long you can go without getting tired. To a lesser extent, it has a scaling chance for you to completely negate small injuries. Thick skin.
It also considerably reduces how much you get hurt by being thrown around when tumbled.
The Sekretar has a =RELENTLESS= of 1.
Sanitars have a =RELENTLESS= of 2-4.
The proletariat has a =RELENTLESS= of 2-3, but the rare seasoned worker can have 4-5.

*** TODO [#B] Character sheets
This is where a player defines for a character their:
- Name
- Adjectives
  ...as a replacement for the traditional 'character description'.
  - How he looks
  - How he sounds
  - How he smells
- Nationality
  - Liverish
  - Kidneystani
  - Arrhythmian
- Caste
  The choice of a caste is permanent and defines a character.
*** DONE [#A] Castes
Ways of organising groups of characters.
Won't do much right now, but it could be useful to set bodygroups before we get clothing.
Eventually will set starting stats, skills, etc.
**** DONE [#B] Fates
This time, if castes are like classes, fates are like subclasses.
***** DONE Scum
Scum constitutes everyone beneath the state. This includes the working class and illegal alien corpses.
Probably the majority of the classes in the game will be scum.

He appears in communal housing with 2-4 roommates, who he is familiar with.
- Factory workers
  Like the Proletariat from the old days.
- Shopkeepers
  These lucky bastards manifest with wealth, property, and a license to access city stocks.
- Stitchers
  The rare few who stuck around during their W.A.S.P. First Aid lessons instead of squeezing in more work.
- Deadbeats
  The chaff of the crop, lacking in money, body parts, and mental faculties. One of few fates spawnable mid-round.
- Psychers
  Freaks who get their kicks growing, synthesizing, and selling drugs. Sometimes even medically relevant ones!
- Foremen
  Lucky proles deemed meritous enough to lead their peers in work. Carries a megaphone and a Sanitar Screamer.
***** DONE Sanitar Squad
You know exactly what Sanitar Squad is.
- Sanitar Scrub
  The default Sanitar available to players.
  Scrubs the filth off the concrete.
- Sanitar Sentry
  The Scrub got a promotion.
  Now he can carry a gun.
- Sanitar Savior
  Medically trained.
  Disinfects.
- Sanitar Seeker
  #+begin_quote
  I'm a cosmic investigator,
  secret agent solving a crime.
  #+end_quote
  (Carries a snubnose revolver)
- Sanitar Superior
  The Superior Sanitar.
  Far in the future, the Sanitar Squad would be led by a single Kapitan.
  (Carries a Sanitar Saber and a Big Fucking Gun)
***** DONE Overlords
At least one Overlord must be readied for the game to start. At least one Overlord will be the Kommandant.
- Sekretar
  The Kommandant's pencil pusher and keypresser. Sysadmin of all red-circuited Liverish computers.
- Adjutant
  The Kommandant's paranoia manifest.
  Does not suffer from standard human burdens or needs.
- *Kommandant*
  Liver Failure Forever!
  Does not suffer from standard human burdens or needs.
  - Has access to XOMBOKOM, the Liverish public announcement system.
***** NO Wild Card
Wild Cards constitute nontraditional fates, usually those who exist primarily to antagonize other players.
- Migrant
  If we use rp_slumtown, we can have mirant groups that attempt to make their way into the city and die horribly on the way.
  This could be a once-availible way for players to rejoin the game as Scum, if they survive.
*** TODO Ghosts
***** Plasm
Similar to Angst in Lifeweb.
****** Possession
Ghosts can possess computers, slowing the terminal down considerably and granting 1 plasm for each command entered by a living user. Possession is managed through 'apt', or the Agonizing Possession Tool. A computer can only be possessed by one ghost at a time.

Possessions can be exorcised by living players using drugs, religious artefacts, etc. If a ghost's possession is removed by exorcism, that ghost will lose all of its plasm.
****** Gaming
Ghosts can earn plasm by solving puzzles and playing simple minigames. These require no input from living players, and thus are done by the ghost in complete isolation. This should be the slowest method of earning plasm, to encourage riskier and more interactive paranormality.
****** Anguish
Like we had in IN3. Being near people who die or get hurt grants plasm, considerably more than gaming or possession.
****** Hauntings
Ghosts can use PLASM to haunt players and objects.
- Slam Door
  - Costs 3 PLASM.
- Commune
  - Costs 5 PLASM.
  - Say one word to the living.
***** snudo
`snudo` or 'supernatural user do' identifies the user as a ghost and grants them access to ghostly commands.
****** apt
Standing for `Agonizing Possession Tool`, apt is how ghosts manage the possession status of a terminal.
- `possess`
  Possesses the computer if not blocked by another ghost. Adding -i (for 'incognito') slows the computer down less, but only has a 50% chance of returning plasm per command.
- `purge`
  Purges possessions from the computer after 20-30 seconds loading. This can be used to supplant a foreign ghost's possession, or to remove your own possession from a terminal in anticipation of an exorcism.
- `trap`
  Costs 10 plasm. The next use of the purge command causes the user to lose all of ther plasm. The trap does not discriminate between targets, meaning that the possessor of a trapped computer cannot unpossess it. Offers protection from ghost competitors at the cost of leaving yourself vulnerable to exorcism.
****** print
Prints one of several ascii images to the terminal. Costs 4 plasm.
- `troll`
  Prints an ascii trollface to the screen.
- `skull`
  Prints an ascii skull to the screen.
- `emblem`
  Prints the emblem of Liver Failure.
- `sotla`
  Prints sotla's eye and then shuts the terminal down.
****** wormsay
Prints a simple ascii worm and a custom message not exceeding 40 characters. Costs 8 plasm.
***** Rebirth
Ghosts respawn by cashing in their plasm with a terminal, earning a better respawn the more plasm they have. Ghosts can only ever respawn as Deadbeats or Wild Card fates. Your remaining plasm is converted into Bones.
- 10 plasm lets you respawn with 2 missing body parts and 1 permanent injury.
- 20 plasm lets you respawn with 1 missing body part and 1 permanent injury, or as a weak Wild Card.
- 30 plasm lets you respawn with 1 permanent injury.
- 35 plasm lets you respawn with 1 missing body part, or as a strong Wild Card.
- 50 plasm lets you respawn miraculously unscathed.
** Personal Resources
- STAMINA
- HUNGER
- THIRST
- DESPAIR
- PAIN
  Controls incapacitation and visual effects from being injured.
** Pain
Pain is what makes the Nightmare. This game aims to discourage the meaningless violence and constant deaths of previous iterations, in favor of more meaningful exchanges in longer lives. To this end, fighting in itself (not just dying) should be heavily discouraged.

A player should only be risking a fight if they feel they are strong or intimidating enough to finish it without much trouble, of if they are desperate enough to risk permanent injury and audiovisual torture.
*** Audiovisual Torture
More about the feeling of pain rather than the damage being done to the flesh.
**** My eyes!
- Being shot puts a giant bullethole in your vision. It should take up at least 1/6 of the monitor.
  - Similarly, being hit with a bladed weapon causes your vision to get slashed up with searing red cuts.
- Being hit causes a bright red flash of varying intensity and length based on the strength of the hit.
- Death causes the screen to immediately turn completely black.
- When knocked out by physical trauma, the screen flashes bright white before fading to black.
- Sustained, continuing pain should be indicated with constant blurring and flashing, and occasional searing spikes of pain that blind the player.
**** My ears!
- "Lobotomy" SFX accompanies being hurt really bad
*** "I ain't dead yet!"
**** Criteria
Still figuring out how this is gonna work.
- Rather than going from fully functional to instantly dead, the character should become less capable with more injuries.
- A character should be made unable to retaliate far before they die.
- Blunt injuries should be largely superficial and heal with relative ease. You should be able to get up and shake hands with someone after a fist fight.
*** Injuries
Injuries are designed conditions applied to the player by chance and depending on the severity of their wounds and the character's ~RELENTLESS~.

Some injuries are temporary and healable, and some may follow your character for the rest of their miserable life.
**** Permanent
- Cyclops
  You can only see out of one side of your screen.
  Received from massive trauma.
- Brain Damage
  HPPD is always set to maximum. You are prone to occasional seizures and tinnitus.
  Received by fainting from blunt trauma.
- Chronic Pain
  Be tortured with pain flareups at low stamina, or randomly throughout your life.
  Received from moderate trauma.
- Limping
  Your legs don't work right. You use more stamina to move and can't run as fast. Received from large blunt trauma.
- Collapsed Lung
  Your stamina recovery and lung capacity is halved.
  Received from massive blunt trauma.
- Sickly
  Your flesh became ill and your immune system never recovered. Diseases progress twice as quickly.
  Received by having a disease and blade/bullet wound simultaneously.
- Crushed Chords
  Talking is hard for you.
  Speech takes longer to form, and even your kin have trouble understanding you.
*** "Recovery"
Blunt trauma can usually be recovered from with simple rest, unless you have a concussion or a broken bone. Minor cuts and scrapes can be healed with disinfectant and bandages.

More major injuries, like broken bones, gunshot wounds, or sliced veins, will require the hands of a "trained" doctor.
** Justice
Rather than criminality being a baked-in game mechanic like in IN3, the laws of Liver Failure are constructed in-character directly from the word of the Kommandant, and enforced manually by His Sanitar Squad. This way, Sanitars actually have to be on the lookout for crimes and question witnesses rather than relying on arbitrary game mechanics.

Laws are hashed out in the beginning of the round while the Sanitars are briefed and before the scum are released from their housing. The Kommandant can codify these laws in the Kommand Konsole.
*** Seekers
Of particular importance in this new system are the Sanitar Seekers, those trained to track down fugitives, trace contact during an outbreak, and solve criminal cases.

They are assisted in this aim by use of a Surface Scanner, which can identify trace amounts of DNA on the surfaces of things and entities. It is then their job to deduce perpetrators from evidence and present their findings to the rest of the Sanitar Squad.
*** Crime & Punishment
At this time, Liver Failure did not have the resources or spare manpower to maintain an endless cycle of execution and emergence, nor the technology to turn corpses into Soylent.

Instead, less permanent means of discouraging crime and instilling dread must be used, at the discretion of the Kommandant and His Sanitars. Sanitars are encouraged to get creative and improvise based on available resources and the crime being punished.

Wrongful or overzealous execution should be strictly punished.
** Memory
Every character has a memory of who they were before the player took control of them. This is displayed as narration at the beginning of the round, and can be displayed with ~KEY_M~.
*** ROUGH SCRIPT
My name is [NAME], I am a/an [OCCUPATION/FATE]
from [NATION]. I know how to [SKILL1], [SKILL2], and [SKILL3]. I'm afraid of [FEAR].

[TRAIT DESCRIPTION(S)]

I love my best friend(s) [FRIEND1] (and [FRIEND2]).

I will destroy my enemy, [NAME].

[DRAMA]
*** Friends
Perform a special ritual and bond your soul with someone else's, forever. If the two characters are of compatible fates, they will become friends. Friends may also be assigned manually by Necromancers, or created randomly among players with the BFF cheat code.
*** Enemies
If you hurt/kill one specific character enough times, your rivalry will be immortalized by Sotla Eirself. Enemies can also be assigned manually by Necromancers.
** Skills
Skills can be learned, and vary widely depending on fate. They unlock some mechanic for a character to make use of.
*** Hands
**** Husbandry
Animals are aggressive towards unqualified ranchers who don't know how to behave.
**** Botany
Trained botanists can understand Plant Cant, the language of flora, and hear their children crying for water and sunlight.
**** Butchering
The precise art of cutting up a creature to avoid the bones, sinew, and poisonous bits.

Untrained hands can only cut dead things into gore, which may technically be edible according to Liverish statutes, but is certainly not palatable.

Trained butchers can not only avoid inedible parts of the creature, but create recognizable cuts that are more easily eaten and can be turned into a variety of recipes.
**** Metalworking
**** Chemistry
A butcher may be able to cut someone open and rip out the bad parts, but it's a tossup whether they wake up after they faint from the overwhelming pain.

Trained chemists know how to use the scarce resources of the Nightmare to create chemicals, including (but not limited to) antibiotics, disinfectants, and anesthetics.
**** Cooking
Everyone has to eat, and raw food can only get you so far before you start spewing out of both ends and die. To avoid this fate, some food must be cooked.

The untrained may be able to stick gore over a fire and roast it to a nearly-edible consistency, but this meager food can't keep a sane man alive for long- and forget trying to feed your friends too.

Those trained in the culinary arts can use kitchenware to make more efficient use of ingredients and produce vast quantities of surprisingly palatable food
*** Brain
**** Literacy
One of the most basic skills of modern society, Liver Failure possesses a 100% literacy rate according to all government reports, but most Livermen would disagree in private.

The illiterate may be able to look at books and terminals, but all text is displayed to them in a font that kitbashes words together into a barely-recognizable mess, or as meaningless symbols, depending on how much effort we want to put in.
**** Commanding
The Kommandant persecuted computer witches and wizards for their dangerous abilties, and now only mundane skill in commanding terminals remains. As it is necessary to much regular life in developed society, computer literacy is not uncommon, but still an obstacle.

Computers will laugh at those who can't use them.
**** Empathy
The ability to understand the expressions and emotions of other people.

Trained empaths are able to see an overview of another character's physical and mental conditions.
** Traits
Traits are inherent to a character, and cannot be gained nor removed through normal means.
All characters can choose 1 trait, but Abnormal characters get an extra trait randomly assigned to them every round.

Traits include mental disorders, disabilities, talents, and compulsions.
*** Physical
- Phlegmy
  You can't stop coughing up slime.
*** Mental
*** Fears
These are traits that cause a loss of sanity when confronted.
- Worms
  Seeing wormlike creatures or dig/tilling soil.
- Water
  Lose sanity when you
  - Ghosts

*** Music
Playing music near cooking food can improve it, the preferred genre depending on the cooking vessel, food type, or ingredients.

Soup likes sludge, stoner metal, and disco.
Roasted food likes organs and pianos.
*** Soup
Soup varieties are generated procedurally based on the properties of the ingredients.
Kind of like how BoTW does food with status effects.

** Ingredients
*** From the Soil
The building blocks of all other foods.
**** Of Animals
- Rat Milk
  Made by rats in order to feed their spawn, and co-opted by humans into a liquid meal.
  Nutritious and delicious, but it spoils fast!
  - Can be fermented into Kumis or mixed with Bloodberries to make Red Cheese.
**** Of Plants
- Bloodberries
  - LEARNED DESCRIPTION
    A tart red berry that grows from a green bush. Good for seasoning foods, but deadly poisonous when uncooked.
  - FOOL'S DESCRIPTION
    A little red berry. Looks yummy!
- Green Leaves
  - LEARNED DESCRIPTION
    The leaves of a bloodberry bush. Not very nutritious or tasty, but technically edible. Eating them raw can cause digestive trouble in the weak-of-body.
  - FOOL's DESCRIPTION
    A handful of green leaves. I guess I could eat these?
- Skinfruit
  The seeds explode!
* Farming
** Fauna
*** Rats
Biomatter recycler that turns garbage into milk and meat. Can be eaten whole once the biohazardous giblets are removed.
*** Bullcrabs
Hulking creatures that graze on assorted flora, and are slaughtered for their abundant meat and shell plates. They can and will deal mortal wounds if not handled with extreme care in absolute silence. It takes one shot from a big gun to put them down safely.
*** Grubs
Once the larval stage of a terrible wasteland beast, these neotenous spawn are renowned for their tender raw flesh and medicinal intestines. Their fragile digestive systems are designed to parasitize living trees and starve them of their saps, but amoeba slime soup is a workable subsitute.
*** Stingers
Blind animals with black skin and potent toxin.
*** Amoebas
A native inhabitant of the Wetlands that has been ranched for eons. Grows feral across most of the continent and eats dust and pollutants out of the air. Inedible raw, and only barely edible once cooked.
** Flora
*** Bloodberry Bushes
A small bush that produces a little red berry and green leaves.
*** Skintrees
These incredibly protective trees are the leading cause of death for Liverish farmers.
They can be safely cut down for skin and wood, or you can risk stealing the valuable fruit,
*** Ribroot
Midnight black sprouts grow from a tuber encased in rib bones. The ribs must be smashed off to release the firm, starchy flesh. The bones can be used for fertilizer while the flesh is cooked.
*** Earthnuts
These small legumes grow from the roots of tangled vines. They can be boiled whole into a porridge or shelled with one's hands and eaten raw.
* Terminals
Terminals will be the primary method by which machines are
manipulated, information is accessed and exchanged, games and music
are played, and religious ceremonies are carried out.
** History
Millennia ago, the first humanoid child of Sotla touched down on
Nightmarish soil. This Kommander, as He was known, founded a
totalitarian labor facility known as Kamp Kommander. Its interned
revolted after decades of cruel treatment, led by a mysterious figure
called The Sorcerer.

After this apocalyptic uprising, dubbed the War of the Sorcerer, much
of the area had been made bare. From this scarcity and barrenness, the
victorious slaves named themselves Death Town. The Sorcerer invented
the first known computers, and wrote their source code into their very
essence with his magicks; His teachings birthed the Terminal Order as
it has existed since then.

The practice of computation has been a massive part of the Nightmare's
history, of Liver Failure and Kidneystan, and before the birth of
Kapitalism, the ci.

In the early days of Liver Failure, they similarly made extensive use
of terminals. After centuries of use and abuse, most computers
available to Livermen had forgotten their source code, and were
basically useless.
** Inbuilt Features
The technology to build new computer parts was lost long ago, and all
the motherboards that remain are hardcoded to use the SNAIL operating
system, which is physically impossible to remove. All SNAIL OS
computers assembled in Liver Failure possess a number of inbuilt
commands considered essential to operating the terminal.
*** lfsp
Commands beneath ~lfsp~ (Liver Failure Shell Protocol) must not prefix
themselves with ~lfsp~.
**** st
~st~ (secure transfer) concerns the transferring of files already on
the computer.
- ~push~
Sends a file directly to
another computer terminal, identified by TIN.
#+begin_example
st push enoch.aud to 666666
#+end_example
- ~host~
Hosts a file on the computer, which can be
pulled by others at their leisure.
#+begin_example
st host enoch.aud
#+end_example
- ~behold~
Shows all files currently hosted by a specified
computer.
#+begin_example
st behold 666666
#+end_example
- ~pull~
Downloads a file that is hosted by
another specified computer.
#+begin_example
st pull enoch.aud from 666666
#+end_example
**** vim
~vim~ (virtual instant messenger) concerns the transmission of text
for use in instant communication over vast distances.
- ~punch~
Get the attention of another operator by playing a sound over their
speakers. Do it too fast, and your computer might /explode/.
#+begin_example
vim punch 666666
#+end_example
- ~tell~
Send a single message to another computer.
#+begin_example
vim tell 666666 "You're a loser!"
#+end_example
***** room
Chatrooms serve as places for extended conversations with one or more
people. Each room has a unique, randomly generated 3 digit ID number.

While inside of a room, text is automatically entered as messages to
the room. Commands must be prefixed with : inside rooms.
- ~create~
Creates a room and prints its ID. Can be given a password.
#+begin_example
vim create dracula
#+end_example
- ~connect~
#+begin_example
vim connect 666 dracula
#+end_example
Connect to a room.
- ~:exit~
#+begin_example
:exit
#+end_example
Leave the current room.
**** lfps
lfps (Low FPS) is a command designed to cause pain in those who
misspell lfsp. It limits the framerate of the game to 15 until the
command is disabled by pressing C-c, or typing quit/exit.
*** law
Displays the Kommandant's Kommandments.
*** tax
Grants read-only access to the tax code.
** Networking
Networking between computers takes place through the Liver Failure
Skull Protocol, or LFSP. This program allows computers to connect to
each other without wires, transferring plaintext in a 'chat' dialog or
data files of any kind.
*** TIN
A Terminal Identification Number is a unique random 6 digit number
used to identify a specific computer terminal, generated when the
SNAIL OS is installed.
** Peripherals
Peripherals are endeared to a computer by sharing physical touch. One
touch is enough to connect a computer to a peripheral, but any
subsequent touches with other computers will change the peripheral's
allegiance.
*** Audio
**** Headphones
Listen in luxurious privacy.  You should probably disinfect them
first.
**** Speakers
Have the potential to be dangerous if used maliciously by ghosts or
hackers to make extremely loud noises. Can be stolen from Livervoice
radios.
*** Keyboard
Ghosts do not require a keyboard to interface with a terminal.
*** Antenna
Allows a computer to communicate with its kin over the latent
DeathWeb. Its range is long enough to justify not coding in a range.
*** Disks
**** Where do they come from?
In Sepsis Town, floppy disks rain from the sky on rare occasions. Some
are empty, some contain files, including music, computer software,
forbidden knowledge, and computer games. Over the millennia, they've
been traded around and abandoned and rediscovered countless
times. They can be found regularly scattered about anywhere someone
might have called home.
**** How do you use them?
Simply insert the floppy disk into the slot on your disk drive. It's
so simple.
**** What's on them?
***** Music
******* Special
- Sunday Morning - The Velvet Underground
- My Marie (Space Funeral)
- Sexual Polyrhythmia (that one LRD keyboard instrumental)
- Every available version of Les Rallizes Denudes' 'White Waking'
******* Eclipse OST
******* Metal
- *Black Magick SS*
  Permission would be impossible to get, but denying
  permission would risk their mask slipping off. It's not likely
  they'd do anything about it if they haven't already, for the
  previous game(s).
- Every other magick musician that'll give Amy permission
  *In The Circle* literally named a song /Ode to Sotla/.
- *Psychrilege*
  Because Psychrilege is also the main creator of the game.
***** Software
******* Kommand Kontrol
Turns an ordinary computer into a Kommand Konsole as long as the disk
is in the drive. Granted to the Kommandant upon coming into being.
- ~kom [text]~
  Sends a message to XOMBOKOM.
- ~law~
  When written by itself, the Kommandments print to stdout.
  + ~law new~
    Adds a new Kommandment.
  + ~law rm #~
    Removes a Kommandment.
  + ~law edit #~
    Edits a Kommandment.
  All terminals connected to the othernet are immediately notified of
  changes to the law in Liver Failure.
******* Skeleton Key
Grants administrator access to Liver Failure's utilities. Given to the
Kommandant and Sekretar at spawn.
- ~vs~
  View surplus.  Shows a list of every item currently in the city
  stock.
******* XOMBOCOM

  It's Snake.
- ~sanitar-says~
  Key-pressing memory game.
- ~scout~
  Infinite runner a la Chrome dinosaur game.

attention to any one until soneone within it gets their attention.
~xom submit~ submits the user to XOM's whimsy. Anything could happen
next.
****** daemon.exe
Running this executable immediently infects the terminal with the
daemon. Black text on a red background.  It is a sentient computer
virus that attempts to spread through spam mail messages.  An infected
computer infects floppy drives with the virus, erasing everything
else.  Attempting to use an infected terminal is dangerous. You might
find yourself unable to look away. It will show you horrible things
and drive you to terror.
* City Stock
The belly of Liver Failure. Keeps items in stasis to be used for the betterment of Liver Failure.
** Access
*** Titherizer
Devours the result of proletarian labor.
