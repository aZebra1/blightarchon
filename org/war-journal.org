*This is where we tell our stories of what really happened.* This page
will serve to contain important announcements, opinion pieces,
reflections, and other things of ours we feel you need to know.

This is not where we post [[https://death.town/~corpse/changes.html][changelogs]], but we may reference big things
in a less technical way here.

** [2024-11-11 Mon] What's happening, Amy?                  :@amanita:status_report:

[[file:images/amy.gif]] Hello!
You've deserved to be addressed more carefully with this information for a while now.

Development has been slow; life circumstances of mine have prompted me recently to focus my time on other creative pursuits, mostly music +ask if you want to hear it+ and other *very deep* rabbit holes for personal development projects +you can also ask about this if you want, but when I say 'endless abyss of madness and terrifying hubris' I'm not joking+.
Normal people would call this a *break.*

The break is ending soon. I still need to work in the background to secure myself financially but between these operations I will be setting to work on **Eclipse** once more.

If you are /not/ new here, you might notice that =death.town/~corpse='s pages (like this one) are rendered differently.

Like the file format these pages are written in (~.org~), each /heading/ can fold up.
Try clicking on any of the items below this to read more -- if you want to know more.
*** /What's the big idea now that you've spent so long doing jack shit?/
I have plans to restructure our workflow into something that works better 'headlessly' -- it should be +easier+ possible for individual contributors to the project to make their changes on their local copies, and then we can have standard good-practice-like procedures.

I've laid out the following for my wishes.
**** TODO *Well written* version control history                     :git:
I know /how/ to write good commit messages. I've even praised *Magit* and *Neogit* for making it easy to do exactly that, piece-by-piece even within a single, massive file.

I haven't been writing good commit messages for a while now and I have no excuse.
***** TODO AI commit messages
It would be good enough to /at least/ set up an Artificial Intelligence to write commit messages for me and I haven't done that yet.

Of course, as is the case with all things related to /AI,/ it is important that its results are not trusted or used blindly... but they'll certainly help, still.

**** TODO Branches, forks, etc.                                 :teamwork:
For the development of features in parallel, and avoiding stepping on each other's toes.

More importantly, this will help us not make horrific changes that break something they shouldn't. If we do, it will be easier to correct the mistakes with little fuss.

This is *super* important when taking into consideration that the project will be free and open source.
**** TODO Stop being stuck with just two editors at a time      :teamwork:
*For now* we pretty much share two editors between each other; Emacs for organization, Neovim for programming.
**** TODO Accountability and paranoia                     :teamwork:blame:
As our workspace is that of a shared/multiplexed terminal, only one user is acting upon our repositories.

As a result, instead of changes appearing to have been made by the individual human being responsible for them, they all appear as being done by =Corpse 1=.

This leads to some state in which even *I* do not know if a specific change was made by me or not. If it isn't obvious, this is really bad.
**** End goal
This will, ultimately, end up resembling something starting to look *sane* in the modern world of collaborative development.
However much more boring the process becomes will be far outweighed by how much better we'll be able to work after the fact.
*** /What's next?/
I have a few things I want to do before we start up again -- mainly
related to this website -- but not /strictly/.

We're gonna write some new documents, make it so updates to our
documentation are broadcast through a larger range of signals, and
correct what we've got already so history isn't lost nor wasted.
*** New pages
**** TODO ~HELP-WANTED.org~
  Because we require /bodies./ It will explain:
  - What and who we need
  - How contributions to the game will be processed
  - The 'agreement' that exists between /us/ and /you/.
    + *US*:
      The decision makers on a first name basis with Sotla.
    + *YOU*:
      If you are not able to write to this war journal, this is not 'your game' like it is ours.
      This doesn't mean we're going to steal anyone's credit or anything; this will be explained further in our 'HELP WANTED' page.
**** TODO ~CASTLE.org~
Because our current TODO is a huge mess and not publicly available.
   
It will serve as the place where we outline our plan for the game, the road(s) ahead, select priorities for tasks, set deadlines... all that good stuff.
   
We already have this in some form, but it is very poorly organized and not easily visible to you.
This file should make it clear what we're doing, what we've done, what we want to do next, and when we're going to do it.
You could compare it to a /roadmap/ or an /agenda/.

*I wish for our =CASTLE= to stand tall and forever, proudly displaying its strong foundation for all to see and plan along with.*
**** TODO ~SORCERY.org~
This file will describe how to install, operate, and develop further with the source code for our project.

Not much I could say here that wouldn't be better written in the file itself; it's only important for +nerds+ /sorcerers./

What is important to more people, however, is the establishment of what is included with the source code -- and what is not -- and what your rights are if you wanna use it for purposes such as making your own game. *This project will be _free_ and _open-source_, or Free Software,* so it's extremely important that you have this information.
  
*I wish for anyone who wants to fight the good fight to make /Roleplaying/ on Garry's Mod /good/ and /immersive/ to use what we've done to achieve that goal; but I also wish to set their expectations correctly.*
*** Propagating the good news
**** TODO Better mechanisms for reporting changes
This may or may not be possible, but I'm gonna try my hardest.
   
At the moment we have something that reports when ~changes.org~ is altered and updates the website's changelog page, but it's very primitive; it doesn't report what the new change is or even its name, and we only have this set up for the one file.

*I wish for every public-facing ~.org~ file to automatically report changes.*

The changes should describe at least the titles of headings/separators.
**** TODO An RSS feed should be established
Right now the only good way to read the updates is on the website.
The only way to know an update even happened is to be in our server on Discord. *That's so bad.*

*I wish for users to be able to read and be informed of updates using any RSS viewing software one prefers.*
+even Emacs can do this+
**** TODO More notification mechanisms
Not everyone even knows what RSS is. I imagine a lot of people on Garry's Mod don't.

Some are more likely to remember to check the updates if they are sent to their Direct Messages on Discord, rather than remembering to check the Discord server every time.

We have a variety of possible options.
***** TODO Scream through [[https://ntfy.sh][ntfy]]
Accessible to all devices, especially mobile.
***** TODO Scream through a Discord bot
Currently =Sotla= is merely a webhook.

We can do better, even using +Lua+ our favorite dialects of Lua.
Maybe there are other things we can do with a Discord bot too.
***** TODO Scream through RSS notifications
This should be a native feature of things that can keep up with RSS at all.
At the time of writing, I don't actually know anything about RSS yet. I'm going to learn just for this.

*I wish for users who want to know when we write something new to know exactly when something changed, and to get at least a glimpse of what's different.*
*** Restructuring of existing pages
The way we do our website was impressive to me a few months ago.

We can, and should, do better if we're going to return from a hiatus. All of this /should/ benefit both the creators and the players immensely.
**** TODO Separation of changelogs
With how we render our pages now, we can combine the following and maybe more into one place:
- the game's source code
- our plans
- this website
  One big change in particular is how pages like this are rendered and styled.

  You may notice how some text /glows/ now, for instance.
- any external things
  Like a Discord bot or ~ntfy~ service.
- ...and so on
With how ~org-refile~ works, or perhaps use of ~org-babel-tangle~, we would be able to keep separate files for each of these things with a file that combines them for more consolidated browsing.
**** TODO Linked
Org mode, which we use to make this site and do a lot more, can utilize /so/ many different kinds of link.

If you somehow get tired of them all, you can even make new ones.

It would be wise for us to interlink as much as we can. That's how you get something close to a 'wiki'.
***** TODO Automate links
I don't know if it's possible, but I would love for some way to scan the documents and automatically replace the first instance of a term that has an associated page/link for it with that same link.

Something like this:
0. Let's say ~sotla.org~ exists and serves as a full article on the being that is /Sotla/.
   Probably somewhere in that file is a line that declares "the term =Sotla= should redirect to /this/ spot", or something equivalent.
   
1. A scan is performed across all of the documentation.

2. Any file that isn't ~sotla.org~ will have its first instance of the term ~Sotla~ replaced with a link produced by step 0.

If these things can't be done, then I'm sure we could at least do something with /tags/.
**** TODO Tablification
Something cool about the way we make this site is how fuckin' easy it is to make tables in it.

Check this shit out.

#+end_src
I can't describe the convenience and joy of creating tables in Org mode any better than [[https://orgmode.org/worg][Worg]] (*W*orld of *Org*) can, which it does [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/tables.html][here]].
**** TODO Organized style sheet
This one isn't as important as the others, strictly -- basically I want to make it a lot easier to make alterations to the site's theme, as easy as it is to write these posts.
*** /Questions...?/
If something is unclear or a question deserves to be asked, I will update this section with your inquiry. You just have to tell me what it is first.
**** /Who fucking cares?/                                   :rude:so_rude:
If you're reading this page and you're looking forward to my next game, I would assume that /you/ do.

If you don't, then you may find it hard to keep up with the project in the future as a player and/or creator.
**** /What's with the keywords like ~TODO~ on some of these sections?/
These sections will be updated as time passes to adjust their status from ~TODO~ to ~DONE~ or otherwise, to reflect their completion status.

They will also, if I remember, include timestamps to reflect their beginning-of-work and successful completion.
***** /Will other documents, like the ~CASTLE~, also work this way?/
Yes.
*** Last words, for now                    :thanks:emotional_vulnerability:
A heartfelt /thank you/ to those users from my audience that took the time to read all this despite my meandering and to those in the future that will read the other pages that are described.

No jokes; I would not write anything this long with intentions laid bare like this for really /any/ public affairs of another kind and/or group of people.

That's assuming that something of this length is all that would be written, too; this post is just the beginning of things to come in the next day(s)... not to mention the amount of time I spent on updating the site's theme.
