The Eclipse features a vast array of controls designed to offer freedom in action to the player. While these controls may seem complicated, they were not made by an ape.

The Eclipse's controls are deliberately strange (and obtuse, to a degree) in order to defamiliarize Garry's Mod players with the gameplay mechanics.
