*This is where we revise history.*

We'd say history is written by the winners, but who wins?

* History
** Supernatural selection
The Nightmare's perilous circumstances and conditions make it a
struggle to exist almost anywhere in it. That's before accounting for
creatures that need to eat you to survive and people that want to eat
you for fun, although in the latter case, something 'normal' is more
likely, like simply crushing your skull open.

Especially in the eternities before modern technology, no single corpse
could hope to survive the Nightmare. Thus, those who /did/ survive were
the ones smart enough to form groups, greatly prolonging their own lives
and leaving a foundation for those who came after. These prototypical
nation-states usually lasted up until the removal of their leadership,
either by the leader's death or the great demoness Democracy and her
'term limits', 'impeachments', and 'elections'.

Generations of life could go on like this, but the end of
such large efforts and subsequent waste of unfathomable time
by a civilization's people from a mere famine/plague/vote was
ultimately not pleasing to the cosmic eye, [[**Sotla*][*Sotla*]].
** Ancient legends
The first humanoid child of Sotla fell into this Nightmare eons ago.
This Kommander, as He was known, founded a nation of slaves whose true name
would be lost to time. In modern speech, it is known as Kamp Kommander.
After more than a century of cruel treatment, the Kamp's slaves revolted
under the command of the enigmatic Sorcerer, and apocalypse swept the land.

The War of the Sorcerer spread ruin to all corners of the known world,
and the slaves named themselves Death Town after this ruin. The Sorcerer
created the first computers to protect and accompany their heirs as they
survived the Nightmare, inscribing their Word into the very fabric of computing.

Though Sotla's child was thrown aside, the birth of this enduring civilization
was nonetheless pleasing to Em.
** Birth of nations
After millennia of silence from Sotla, E graced the Nightmare with Eir spawn
once again. These Sotlian twins, the Kommissar and the Kommandant, have both
founded nations of their own; Kidneystan and Liver Failure respectively.

the Kommissar travelled east and birthed the city of Renalgrad, before
pushing into the great snowy north to secure a borderland and a ready
supply of resources conquered from the native tribes of the frozen wastes.
Under the banner of Kommunism, Kidneystan rose to become the eminent power
of the entire Nightmare, much to the chagrin of the Kommandant.

Angered by the boldness of His twin and jealous of Kidneystan's success,
the Kommandant marched on the southern wetlands, where the city of
Liver Failure had been languishing under the control of its Council.
The Kommandant marched on the Chambers and granted Himself the title
of Eternal Ruler, though He was still roundly mocked by the Kommissar
for His failures as a leader which left Liver Failure half consumed
by a mountain of corpses and rubble.
** Tragic context
<<<<<<< HEAD
/Tell the story! C'mon!/

For countless millennia, the surface of the Nightmare has existed as a bubbling pot of ideologies, nations, settlements, communities, and endless sinkholes into nothingness. This pattern changed with the arrival of two beings on this mortal plane: The Kommissar, and the Kommandant.

Both were created by the blood of Sotla, and possess no need for worldly pleasures beyond the faith and adoration of their chosen people.

*Liver Failure* once constituted a region of wetlands inhabited by innumerable human settlements, some small and some large. This was until the Kommandant arrived and orchestrated a popular coup. This would come to be called the Night of Long Pipes, after the lead pipes wielded by the Kommandant's paramilitaries. Now that His rule is cemented, He aims to transform Liver Failure into a hardy national organism capable of thriving under the harsh conditions of the Nightmare, with Himself as its central nervous system.

The workers of Liver Failure find fulfillment in unending labor, toiling until death however it may find them. They are the red blood cells of a great beast that only grows stronger the more they sacrifice of themselves to the unceasing machine. The Kommandant's Sanitar Squad, on the other hand, do their best to serve as Liver Failure's white blood cells. Not necessarily protecting the red, but eliminating pathological threats before they reach the vital organs.

The Kommunist republic of *Kidneystan* to the northeast has seen a significantly less tumultuous founding than its "little brother" in Liver Failure. Orders of magnitude larger and more industrially capable, the Kommandant seems to have tripped where the Kommissar strode, enraging the already roaring flame of their mutual rivalry. Built around the bustling city of Renalgrad, it stretches northeast into uncountable miles of snowy, frostbitten wasteland.
=======
Today is a special day, as it marks the coming of the Ocular Eclipse.
The ramifications of the Eclipse are not well understood, but few believe
they can be anything positive. Sotla's gaze will leave this world, and Eir
light will be blocked from the Nightmare below, if only for a moment.

Though Liver Failure stands, it stands on unsteady ground. The choices
the Kommandant makes in addressing the forces of nature and man that beset
Him will decide the fate of His nation and the Nightmare at large.

Liver Failure Forever!

*** *Sotla*
As it turns out, that red thing in the sky is actually a cosmic
eyeball. What the fuck?
**** Who?
That's a tough question.

Our starscopes are pretty sure that it looks like this:

[[file:images/sotla.png]]
**** Can you be more specific?
Not really.

What /is/ certain is that this thing watches us from the darkness above, below, and all around us.

Despite the deniability of every other being that's popped up in mortal mythology since history were first recorded and mutilated, none have been able to deny the existence of Sotla, not even the Kommandant. It's the one thing that matches any description of godly beings that can be proven to exist.
**** What does it do?
It watches. It knows.
**** That's it?
That's it.
*** Sotlians
The substitutes for fallible human leadership spawned by Sotla.
**** Sorry, the what?
They look something like this.

**** That leaves more questions than answers--
/Chosen by Sotla to incarnate, made with dust from the stars;/ a
Sotlian is a /post-human/ that does not need to eat, drink, breathe,
or sleep.

All that is necessary for Him to live is the mere presence of
starblood in His vessels and the structural integrity of His brain.

Such a leader often lives centuries, sometimes millennia to prolong
His land's history and expand His influence -- if war and betrayal
does not kill Him first, madness will.

With only the mind to listen to within the body, each more uncountable
year of continued existence contributes to erratic and irrational
behavior in the immortal leader until He kills Himself or makes the
kind of mistakes that will get Him killed.
**** Can you give me an exam--
Today, the most notable of these are Liver Failure's *Kommandant* and
Kidneystan's *Kommissar* who have been fierce rivals since Sotla gave
them life. Driven by spite, the Kommandant wants few things more than
to surpass and invade His rival's domain.
